A few days ago, on the occasion of having a big new birch bed, I started a massive undertaking: To get rid of the _crap_ in my bedroom. This endeavor was inspired by the simplicity-minded folks at the forum [r/minimalism](http://www.reddit.com/r/minimalism).  I was determined to organize the countless papers and memorabilia that I had accumulated over the years and that filled the bulging bookshelfs and cardboard boxes and closets. I was looking to take a breath, and perhaps make my room as cozy as [this one](http://www.scottstedman.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/14.jpg).

After three days of hard work, I'm proud to say that I've succeeded. I looked through everything, swallowed tears of nostalgia that emerged while looking at old stories I had written, and threw away tons of stuff I didn't need, several Hefty Bags' and many dozen kilograms' worth of it. Since I only use my laptop nowadays (portable + SSD + Linux = awesome), I unplugged my complex desktop PC apparatus, and gave the tower, the 27" screen, the speakers, the keyboard, and the mouse to other family members. My desk is almost completely clean now.

In the process, I collected paper that I wanted to keep. This included a myriad of creative work, noteworthy school notes, yearbooks, diplomas, and flight tickets. All of these things I placed into one cardboard boxâ€” they all fit. I reduced the essence of 15 years' worth of intellectual activity into this single box
