This biographical movie details the life of the singer Johnny Cash, from early boyhood in Arizona over drug problems to recovery and marriage with the love he has long yearned for, the charming and beautiful singer June Carter.

Throughout most of the movie, Cash is depressed and unhappily married to a woman he doesn't love, while at the same time experiencing increasing success onstage. It is on tour that he meets and performs with June Carter, but while he is mesmerized by her she is irritated at his instability and insecurity that stems from his father's unsatisfaction with his son. Johnny's brother Jack died while using a sawmill at an early age, and their drunkard father angrily yelled that it was the wrong boy who died, continuing to express his disappointment even when Johnny has grown up and is famous of his estate: "Mister big shot, mister pill poppin' rock star. Who are you to judge, you ain't got nothin', big empty house, nothin', children you don't see, nothin', big ol' expensive tractor stuck in the mud, nothin'".

Unhappy with his lifestyle and June's disgust, Johnny eventually recuperates from the drugs and alcohol, and on February 22nd 1968, at the age of 35, proposes to June Carter while they are performing a duet onstage, and she accepts. Unfortunately, the latter half of his life is left out of the film, during which he recorded more pensive and religious songs, such as his famous cover of _Hurt_.
