Another hilarious movie with Leslie Nielsen. Compared to the first part, this sequel was considerably richer in satire, touching (lightly) on the subjects of environmentalism and politics. This time, Lt. Frank Drebin has to stop rich oil magnates from replacing an adviser to the president who is green-friendly with one who will recommend investing in oil and nuclear power. Plenty of laughs along the way, though none as hard as those in the first film.
