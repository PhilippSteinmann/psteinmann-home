subtitle: Movie Review
---
A sad, heavy Argentinian film. The story is told from the perspective of a retired detective, Benjamin Esposito, reflecting on his life and trying to write a novel about a rape and murder case that he can't get out of his head. Past and present intertwine and to show his insecurities and nostalgia for the times that were. He regrets the death of his friend in place of his own and thinks longingly of the opportunities he missed with the woman he loved and of the unforgettable devotion of the crime victim's husband, Morales. 

Even though Morales tells the old Esposito to stop chasing his memories, because he will remain with "a thousand pasts and no future", it is revealed at the end that he, too, did not move on after the tragic death of his wife. Meanwhile, after 25 years of waiting and failed relationships on both sides, Esposito finds the courage to reunite with his old love.
