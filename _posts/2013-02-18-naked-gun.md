title: The Naked Gun (1988)
subtitle: Movie Review

This classic comedy film features the hilarious Leslie Nielson as a cop trying to uncover an assassination plot on the queen and falling in love with the mistress of the villain along the way. The plot is secondary, however, and only sets the scene for one funny mishap after another. A very light-hearted and silly movie.
