A few days ago, on the occasion of having gotten a big new bed, I started a massive undertaking, something that I'd been wanting to do for years: To get rid of the _crap_ in my bedroom. Inspired by the simplicity-minded folks at [r/minimalism](http://www.reddit.com/r/minimalism),  I was determined to organize the countless papers and memorabilia that I had accumulated over the years and that filled the bulging bookshelfs and cardboard boxes and closets. I was looking to take a breath from chaos.

I looked through everything, swallowed tears of nostalgia that emerged while looking at old stories I had written, and threw away tons of stuff I didn't need, several Hefty Bags' and many dozen kilograms' worth of it. I unplugged my bulky desktop PC apparatus which I didn't really use anymore and gave all the parts to family members. My desk is almost completely clean now, a blank slate for thought.

In the process, I collected a moderate stack of papers that I really wanted to keep. It included a myriad of creative work, interesting school notes, yearbooks, diplomas, and flight tickets. A documentation of my life. All of these things I placed into a single cardboard box. In my decluttering fervor, I was able to reduce the essence of 15 years' worth of intellectual activity into this single box, and stow it away in a corner of my closet. Out of sight, out of mind.

Did all this trash hurt the environment? Undoubtedly. But since I realized the benefits of having and buying little, it might be a good investment.
