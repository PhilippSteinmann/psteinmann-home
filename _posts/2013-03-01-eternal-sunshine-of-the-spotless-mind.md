I'm not yet sure about how to describe this movie; it was a powerful flurry of emotions and relationships and love, and, most of all, memories. The story is no simpler than the messages it conveys, and, with its inverted plot structure and purposeful dreamlike distortion, leaves the viewer with a feeling more than a concrete lesson.

The movie tells of the strange love of two seemingly incompatible people: the 
shy, self-critical Joel, and the quirky, out-going Clementine. They meet at a
beach party at which they are both awkward outsiders, and as they get to know one
another, his thoughtfulness and her spontaneity seem to complement each
other, and they fall in love. 

For the first twenty minutes, or so, however, we
see Joel waking up confused and irritated, and skipping work to ride a train to a remote 
station, where he meets a girl who we find out is Clementine. It is revealed gradually 
that the reason they are as strangers to each other, even though they seem to
have had an entire relationship before, is that both had their memories of the other
erased. 

The reason is that after a while, their love weakened, Joel becoming annoyed at Clementine's neediness and false 
playfulness, and her becoming bored and feeling locked in with his passivity and stoicism. 

Eventually, this led to a dramatic breakup, and, without telling Joel,
Clementine decided to go to a special institution that allowed patients to 
erase a certain part of their memory. When he came to apologize on
Valentine's Day, Joel was confused to find her not recognizing him, and 
heartbroken when a friend told him the truth of how she got rid of his 
memory. Seeing no option, he decided to do the same. After having created a 
map of his emotions toward Clementine using objects that he brought to the clinic
and memories that he talked about with them, the doctor and his technicians began working.

Much of the action now occurs within the mind of the sedated Joel, as he 
relives his memories with Clemetine in reverse chronological order, conscious of the
fact that these scenes are slowly disassembled, one after another. But as he 
progresses and witnesses their love from the late difficult stages to the 
passionate ones in the middle, he realizes that these moments of emotionality
are too valuable, that he loved Clementine too much to want to give up all 
his intimate memories with her.

Joel begins fighting the fading of the memories; the movie blurs the line 
between reality and dream, and the Clementine inside
his head becomes conscious, too, and together they struggle
to "get out of the map": to escape together to memories unrelated
to her, since these won't be erased. In the end, however, they are pulled back
toward their memories together, and it becomes impossible to fight. 

The last memory he reexperiences with Clementine is the first one, when they met
at the beach party. After the sun has set and everyone has gone home except them two, she
tries to convince him to stay with her at a vacant vacation house on the beach;
but he, as he narrates disappointedly himself, ran away, scared of her impulsiveness.
It didn't stop them from falling in love with each other, but in hindsight Joel
tells Clementine that he should have stayed, or at least said goodbye. She, 
the Clementine in his dreams, tells him that he can say goodbye now, and they 
kiss as the beach house, and the entire memory landscape, disintegrates around them.
The last words that she whispers to him are: "Meet me at Naukau"--- the train station.

It is this train station that Joel, after waking up from sedation and seeming to have
forgotten everything, subconsciously goes to, and where he meets and
falls in love with Clementine all over again. But when he drives her home she
finds a letter from the memory-erasing clinic, which they have both forgotten
to prevent confusion. A female employee at the clinic had kissed the middle-aged and married doctor 
during Joel's operation only to find out that she had done 
it before and fallen in love with him, but had her memory erased at 
his request. Being shocked and having decided that the practice was unethical, she sent back all the 
tapes with the conversations of the patients.

Joel and Clementine go to their separate apartments, but she finds him shortly later in his,
listening to his tape. As the speakers play a melancholic Joel pointing out all the faults of Clementine,
the two decide that despite their individual flaws, despite the fact
that they've tried this relationship before and it failed, their mutual attraction is too strong, and
they get back together, defying the prophecy of the past.
