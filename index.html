    <h1>Programming </h1>
    <p class="large">Ever since I learned Python a few years ago, I&rsquo;ve been mesmerized by programming and the power it holds; it is astounding that I can tell a machine what to do to solve complex problems, using abstract symbolic manipulations that were unheard of a few generations ago. </p>

        <h2>Web Development </h2>
        <p>I do web development for my school&rsquo;s robotics team, where I am vice president of marketing. I love using Ruby on Rails, AJAX, and good design to create a smooth user experience, though I&rsquo;m not the fastest, since I like to do it slowly and with care. I&rsquo;m immersed in web startup culture through <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>, and find the rapid work cycle of web development so appealing that I could see myself doing stuff like this in the future. </p>

    <h2>Linux </h2>
        <p>I switched from Windows to Linux for programming after becoming convinced that it was the right tool for the job; I never looked back. Running the smooth <a href="http://crunchbang.org/">Crunchbang 11</a> on an SSD-powered laptop, I've been learning how to do a lot of cool things over the terminal (such as reading emails), and wield the power of awesome programs such as vim and sed. </p>

    <h1>Literature</h1>
    <p class="large">I&rsquo;ve been reading for almost my whole life; from historical fiction to popular science, I find books a great way to broaden one&rsquo;s horizons and experience different mindsets. </p>
    <p>I&rsquo;ve got to be honest and admit that with the work from robotics and school work, I don&rsquo;t have as much time to read as I&rsquo;d like to. I&rsquo;m trying to change that, but right now the only thing I read regularly is the New Yorker. </p>
